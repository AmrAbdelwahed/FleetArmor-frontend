                      Labour shortages are a frequent issue in construction. These shortages can result in significant project delays and financial losses. Furthermore, to compensate for the lack of workers, many construction workers work longer hours, creating safety concerns. This is particularly true for large construction projects like plazas, condos, or other large-scale buildings that rely on committed staff to see the project through to completion.
